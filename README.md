Sonic Ether's Unbelievable Shaders (SEUS) for Minecraft, "dried" out to work more efficiently on lower-end devices.

## Accessing the shaders
For each of the shaders that I have modded, find it from the "branch" above.

## Applying the shaders
You would need Optifine, Minecraft Java Edition and TLauncher (optional).
First, download the ".zip" file of the desired shader you want.
If you're on Windows, use the "run" application to instantly access the hidden directory.
Enter
```
%appdata%
```
into the "run" app. Then, locate `.minecraft`. Inside, you'll find a `shaderpacks` folder. Paste the ".zip" file inside.

Launch Minecraft, and you should now be able to use the shaderpack.
