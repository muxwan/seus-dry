Sonic Ether's Unbelievable Shaders (SEUS) for Minecraft, "dried" out to work more efficiently on lower-end devices.

## Accessing the shaders
For each of the shaders that I have modded, find it from the "branch" above.

## Applying the shaders
You would need Optifine, Minecraft Java Edition.
First, download the ".zip" file of the desired shader you want.
If you're on Windows, use the "run" application to instantly access the hidden directory.
Enter
```
%appdata%
```
into the "run" app. Then, locate `.minecraft`. Inside, you'll find a `shaderpacks` folder. Paste the ".zip" file inside.

Launch Minecraft, and you should now be able to use the shaderpack.


## Just a quick mockery of old man SEUS
If you download a fresh copy of any [Sonic Ether shader](https://www.sonicether.com/seus/), chances are... you'll find a `LICENSE.txt` file. I would like to criticize how it has been written.

First of all, the LICENSE file begins with :
```
Sonic Ether's Unbelievable Shaders (here and hereafter referred to as 'SEUS') are the intellectual property of Cody Darr (here and hereafter referred to as 'Sonic Ether') and the copyright belongs to him.
Distributed is the source code of SEUS. You are granted the right to use and modify SEUS and its source for your own personal use.
```
So far so good. We can notice a slight tone of arrogance about Cody here. Next paragraph :
```
It is, however, interdicted to (re-)distribute SEUS as it is provided or in any modified version in parts or in its entirety in any way without explicit written permission by Sonic Ether. You may ipso facto not create mirrors, use parts of SEUS - including snippets from its source code - in your own work, claim to be the author of SEUS or publish derived shader packs under your own or Sonic Ether's name.
```
Bruh. He states that you cannot use `snippets from its source code` either. Did you know that almost all GLSL shaders look alike? For people unaware about how shaders work and how they are written, this message is certain to give them a fright and to further clarify about their restrictions. However, if you open up the source codes of BitSlabLabs (BSL), Chocapic13, etc. you'll notice that they're all very similar to SEUS. So... not impressed, since Sonic Ether doesn't have the right to prevent anyone using parts of the code.

Next paragraphs :
```
You may freely publish Minecraft footage with SEUS installed given that you do not infringe applicable law. If you feature SEUS as the main content, you must provide reference to a description of SEUS as found in the official thread on the Minecraft forums.

Should you opt to release a subsequent series of videos that do not feature SEUS as their main content, e.g. 'Let's plays', it is sufficient to provide this reference once in the first installment featuring SEUS or its corresponding description.
```
Another major "bruh". Cody Darr's work is splendid, but that doesn't mean he should be scummy about it. Look at how other great programmers and developers work. Look at the GNU and Linux community. Even if he doesn't intend to keep his software open-source, technically *it is*, since Minecraft shaders work on generating the binary from the source files and not from any compiled binary files.
Yet, others' videos and forums are their own content and it is their ethical concern whether or not they provide descriptions and/or links referring back to the original creator.

The remainder of Sonic Ether's LICENSE :
```
This software is provided 'as is' and comes without warranty of any kind including, but not limited to, the implied warranty that it works the way intended or advertised. In no event is Sonic Ether liable to you for any damage that arises out of the use or malfunction of SEUS including, but not limited to, hardware failure, loss of income and negative impact on your Minecraft experience. The entire risk as to every aspect of SEUS is with you.

This agreement shall be generally referred to as the 'SEUS License'. Sonic Ether is free to change this license at any point in time without further notice. You can always find the latest version on http://www.sonicether.com.

Legal domicile for any disputes arising from or in connection with SEUS or its use is Arizona, USA. Each clause of this agreement is subject to applicable law and only to be applied to the extent is permitted by applicable law.

In case any part of this agreement should for any reason be considered invalid, illegal or be deemed unenforceable, Sonic Ether shall undertake to replace the aforementioned part by a term that comes closest to the intended meaning and is all valid, legal and enforceable. The remaining parts of this agreement are therefrom unaffected in their validity.

By installing, downloading, storing a copy of or using SEUS you agree to all of the terms and conditions. They can and will, if deemed neccessary by Sonic Ether, be enforced by going to law.

For further questions concerning SEUS, its use or this license please contact Sonic Ether on Twitter: https://twitter.com/sonic_ether

I am speechless. This is technically just a "mod" for a game. Why does so much legal protection need to placed and declared for a thing as futile as this?
